# Laser-harp
Building a Laser Harp using an Arduino. 
  
Essential Components:  
1.Arduino UNO
2.Light Dependent Resistors (LDR)
3.Low-Power laser modules
4.Piezoelectric Buzzer
5.10kΩ Resistors

Info:  
In a laser harp, laser beams replace traditional strings. The beams are emitted by lasers and detected by the LDRs. Each beam corresponds to a specific musical note. When a player interrupts a beam with their hand, the sensor detects the drop in light intensity and sends a signal to the circuit. This signal is the processed to generate a musical tone corresponding to the interrupted beam. By moving their hands through the beams, the player "plays" the harp, with each beam acting as a unique string producing different notes.
